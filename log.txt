        "description": "10,000 sentences is an app that will help you learn new words in your target languages.\r\n\r\nYou will be presented with a series of sentences where you need to guess the order of words. If your guess is correct, the app will find a new (and slightly more complex) sentence.\r\n\r\nThe application currently has 24 languages (see below for the list). Each language is available in two \"directions\". For example \"French for English speakers\" and \"English for French  speakers\". More languages will be added in future.\r\n\r\nIf you want to check the translations for words, make sure you have Google Translate installed. \r\n\r\nThe application uses \"text-to-speach\" (TTS), but not all languages are available on all Android phones. Some languages have also commercial TTS engines available on Google Play.\r\n\r\nAs you progress with new sentences, you can create \"annotations\" on words you don't know. Annotations can be anything, but the best usage is to use them to create your own dictionary. More than one word can have the same annotation (so, for example, one verb in different tenses will have one translation/annotation). \r\n\r\nThe application is free and open source. All the sentences are taken from the Tatoeba dataset (licensed under CC-BY 2.0).\r\n\r\nThe source is available here: https://github.com/tkrajina/10000sentences\r\n\r\nList of languages:\r\n\r\nCzech (for English speakers): 9268 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Czech speakers): 8126 sentences\r\nBulgarian (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Bulgarian speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nSerbian (for English speakers): 9634 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Serbian speakers): 6911 sentences\r\nDanish (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Danish speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nSwedish (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Swedish speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nUkrainian (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Ukrainian speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nDutch (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Dutch speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nFinnish (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Finnish speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nMacedonian (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Macedonian speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nHungarian (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Hungarian speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nPolish (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Polish speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nItalian (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Italian speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEsperanto (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Esperanto speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nLatin (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Latin speakers): 11727 sentences\r\nTurkish (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Turkish speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nGreek (modern) (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Greek (modern) speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nRomanian (for English speakers): 8164 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Romanian speakers): 8186 sentences\r\nArabic (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Arabic speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nHebrew (modern) (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Hebrew (modern) speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nGerman (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for German speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nFrench (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for French speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nRussian (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Russian speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nPortuguese (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Portuguese speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nSpanish (for English speakers): 12000 sentences\r\nEnglish (for Spanish speakers): 12000 sentences",
